## ioBroker Internet Printing Protocol Adapter

The adapter polls configured network printers using the Internet Printing Protocol (IPP) and publishes read-only availability, printer state, toner or ink levels, and supported page counters. It uses `Get-Printer-Attributes` over IPP/2.0; device and firmware support varies, so optional attributes may not be reported by every printer. Compatibility depends on each printer’s IPP implementation; no particular device has been verified against this implementation.

Node.js 24 or newer, Admin 8.2.0 or newer, and js-controller 7.2.2 or newer are required.

## Configuration

Add one or more printers in the adapter settings. Each row contains:

Printer entries are shown in individually collapsible sections, with fields arranged responsively for narrow and wide screens.

| Setting | Description |
| --- | --- |
| ID | Stable object-tree identifier; use 1-32 letters, digits, underscores, or hyphens. German umlauts are transliterated (`ä` to `ae`, `ö` to `oe`, `ü` to `ue`, `ß` to `ss`). |
| Label | Display name for the printer. |
| Host | Printer hostname or IP address. |
| Port | IPP port; defaults to `631`. |
| IPP resource path | Printer resource path; defaults to `/ipp/print`. |
| Use TLS | Use IPPS over TLS. |
| Verify TLS certificate | Validate the printer's TLS certificate; disabled by default for self-signed printer certificates. |

The polling interval defaults to 60 seconds and is limited to 10 seconds through 24 hours. The request timeout defaults to 5000 ms and is limited to 500-30000 ms. The adapter only sends the read-only `Get-Printer-Attributes` operation; it does not submit print jobs or change printer settings. Configure only printers that expose an IPP endpoint at the selected host, port, and resource path.

Invalid printer rows are skipped with a warning that identifies the invalid fields. Debug logging reports configured field names and value types without printing configured values.

When a printer is switched off or temporarily unreachable, the adapter marks it offline without a warning-level log; connection and timeout details are available at debug level. IPP protocol, TLS, and configuration errors remain warnings.

## States

Each configured printer gets a device with `status`, `supplies`, `counters`, and `details` channels. Supplementary IPP attributes are created directly under `details` (for example, `details.printer_location`); attributes already represented by the canonical status, model, and counter states are not duplicated. The adapter requests all IPP attributes and creates states for returned values except explicitly excluded capabilities, verbose attribute families, and raw marker values; selected capability/default attributes are retained. Arrays and structured values are stored as JSON strings; scalar values keep their boolean, number, or string type. Unknown, non-excluded attributes are added automatically under `details`. `status.online` is always present; `status.model`, `status.message`, and numeric `status.state` are published when supported. The state value is `0` (`off`) while the printer is unreachable, and returns to the reported IPP state when it reconnects. Previously read measurements remain available while offline. IPP marker levels are normalized to percentages using the reported low/high bounds and rounded to two decimal places. `pages_completed`, `impressions_completed`, and `media_sheets_completed` are created only when the printer reports them. Missing values are cleared rather than replaced with zero during successful polls. Request details are not logged.
